                <p>My name is Brigham Mueller and this website was made to tell a little bit about myself and show what
                    I can do. I am an aspiring web designer, gamer, home chef, and dad joke extraordinaire.
                    Coding and designing have always been something that have peaked my interest as a way to explore my
                    creative side while still being a relevant way to make a living. Outside of my time learning and
                    growing my coding experience you can find me, as mentioned, two places: on the computer gaming or in
                    the kitchen.
                    Gaming for me has always been a way to be competitive and enjoy myself at the same time. It was also
                    how I connected with a lot of my siblings and gave us a means to spend time together.
                    My time in the kitchen is often spent trying new recipes or perfecting ones I already know. I get a
                    lot of satisfactin out of the enjoyent that other people get when they eat what I have made.
                </p>
                <p>Aside from my 3 main interests I love to play soccer, travel, and hang out with my family. Family is
                    super important to me and I try to spend as much time with them as I can. We love to play board
                    games, word games, video games, or pretty much anything where we can have a good time together.
                    I have traveled many places around the world including: China, Ukraine, Costa Rica, Belize, Mexico,
                    and Canada. My family is really into soccer and I personally played for about 13 years growing up on
                    very competitive teams.
                </p>
                <p>Beyond my personal interests, I am a very logical person who likes to think through pretty much
                    everything I do. I believe in being a kind person to everyone around me and try to help out as much
                    as I can.</p>
