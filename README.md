# Portfolio

# Description
  This site was created to give info about me, give contact info to get in contact with me, and display some of my best web sites and apps.  Connect page has email, phone number, and links to my resume, github, and linkedin.  Best web sites on the portfolio page include Crave It, Quiz-site, and Password Gewnerator.  The portfolio site was my first solo delve into Google's material design CSS framework.  While everything looks clean and polished, getting things to function how I wanted was far more of a challenge than I anticipated.  Still have not figured out how to center items within the grid system.
  The future of this project is to expand on the design and make it even cleaner and more responsive, potentially later making it in react.js.  Also, more websites will be added to the portflio pages as others are created
